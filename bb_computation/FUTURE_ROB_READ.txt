== Note of where you stopped ==
SD Card-reader arrived. Just completed the bb_util::Vec2D class
which was designed to hold all of the drawing information for the
get_vector_representation or whatever it was called in mmcx_model.

Should now be able to decode the layer phase to get the angle,
use the stored weights for the magnitude and broadcast this to
a python grpahing node. Notes on how to decode the layer
are in the mmcx_model file.

Finally, you need to figure out the graphing mode. Look to your
box-plot example for this, iirc you need to find the underlying
artist object and figure out how to modify it. We want a polar
plot of each "cue" as perceived by the network along with the
integrated CL1 signal. Speaking of, I haven't figured out a way
to display a length to the CL1 signal. There's no notion of
overall certainty in your integrated signal because all of the
weights always sum to 1. Maybe this is what Barbara was
talking about...
