/** 
\mainpage

This package provides access to utilities which need to be
consistently defined across the codebase, both 3rd party and
custom.

Primarily this means ROS message formats, but global concepts
(such as Cues) are also represented here.

See the file list for more information.

This package provides no nodes.
